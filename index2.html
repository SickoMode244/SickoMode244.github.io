      <h1> Who I am and What's My Favorite Book? </h1>

  <p style="color:black;">My name is Gabriel DeStefano. I was born and raise in the Bronx and I just recently turn 19.
    Throughout my life I had face many challenges that took a huge impact on me. Started off as being the
    shy and timid kid in class, the big fat boy who gets picked on, bullied everyday, been told I'll never find love, got put into fights, almost lost my life and more.
    If I was the Gabriel back then I would be saying to myself I'm not goning to make it nowhere. However, the Gabriel
    today thinks differently now. Up until today I was able to truly rewrite my story and change every bad thing that has happen to me.
    Because of this mental change I was able to do more and become more productive. Getting rid of anything toxic or negative in my life and really focus on me and
    more. Today I'm an artist, a trainer, a bodybuilder in training, a business man, a big brother and more.

    <p style="color:black;"> The book I chosen to talk about is called "The Maze Runner". This book takes place in a world
      where the population is taken out by a virus and that the virus was controlled by an organization known as wicked. Only teenagers and kids posses the cure within their D.N.A.
      The reason I chosen this book is because it relates to toady's event of the COVID virus. The book allows an understanding of why people act out of nature
      when we are in a life crisis. It allows people to show their true nature as human being and their true colors of an individual. Events that happen to before reflect off of the book.
      I learn that my friends are very two face and out of line. Allowing my to see their true colors and understand that they are not my real friends. In this Book
      I will be explaining the plot of the book and the charcaters as well as information about the author.
