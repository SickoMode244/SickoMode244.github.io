<h2> Information about Nutrition/Diet: (Marco, Micro, and Calories) </h2>

<h3> Marconutrients: </h3>
<p> A type of food that required in a large amount in the diet. These large amounts of food are broken up in three different
  categories protein, carb, and fat. </p>

  <h4> Protein: </h4>
  <p>any of a class of nitrogenous organic compounds that consist of large molecules composed of one or more long chains of amino acids and are an essential
     part of all living organisms, especially as structural components
     of body tissues such as muscle, hair, collagen, etc., and as enzymes
     and antibodies.</p>

     <p>any of a large group of organic compounds occurring in foods
       and living tissues and including sugars, starch, and cellulose.
       They contain hydrogen and oxygen in the same ratio as water (2:1)
       and typically can be broken down to release energy in the animal body.</p>

       <p>Fats are nutrients that give you energy. Fats
         have 9 calories in each gram. Fats help in the absorption

  <h2> How to start adapting the Healthy Lifestyle?? </h2>

  <h3> Diet and Training Program: </h3>
  <p> Now that you understand the concept of what occurs when you property understand food and your body
    , you just got to figure out what works best for you. Everyone is different in terms of body type, strength, what food works best for them,
    and other key factors. Most importantly your fitness goals. Are you maintaining weight, you want to gain weight or loose weight?
    To start we must figure out your daily caloric intake. This is bascially where we determine how much an individual is suppose to eat.
    To calcuate your calories we will use a marco calcuator. Here is the link:
    <a href="https://www.calculator.net/macro-calculator.html">Marco Calcuator </a>
<br></br>


    Once you figure out your calorie intake we must figure out a diet plan that fits best for you.
    Here is a Document Link that will show you what types of food are best when dieting and overall health,
    as well as an exmaple of a meal plan from one of my clients:
    <a href="Nutrition&DietPlanExample.html">Nutrition Example</a>
<br></br>




    Now that we went over food, we need to figure out a workout split for you.
    This will allow you to determine how will you spend your time at the gym. There are 4 ways to create your workout splits.
    Its divided up into how well inform or how advance you are in the gym.
    Here are four links to the different splits that are made in my personal training program:<br></br>
    <a href="FullBodySplit.html">3 Day Full Body Workout Split</a>
    <br></br>
    <a href="Upper&LowerSplit.html">4 Day Upper and Lower Body Workout Split</a>
    <br></br>
    <a href="PushPullLeg/Upper&Lower.html">5 Day Push,Pull,Leg, Upper, and Lower Split</a>
    <br></br>
    <a href="PushPullLeg.html">6 Day Push Pull Leg Split </a>
    <br></br>




    And there you go, everything else is up to you. Remember the effort you put in the gym lifting weights and doing cardio same thing applies in a diet.
