  <h2> Quetsion 1 <em>What is My favorite Film/Movie or TV show?</em></h2>
  <h3> Answer: Monster Inc</h3>
  <p><strong> My favorite movie of all time is a classic pixar animated studio film known as “Monster Inc.”</strong>
  This is one of the best movies I grew up on as a kid. In this film we are taken to a world filled with monsters. 
  These Monsters live among each other as equals just like humans, however few monsters are selected to go actually in the human world through doors from children closets to scare them. 
  The Monster scaring the kids provides scream energy which creates a powerful amount of energy to supply the city for power. 
  No pun intended, but the scariest thing about that job is that the monsters were taught that human children are toxic, whatever they touch becomes toxic as well. 
  So if a monster gets touched by these items or by the child itself they become toxic. 
  But from what all monsters were taught apparently what they know was wrong. 
  Two monsters were able to find out the truth about how kids aren’t dangerous and that there are better ways of obtaining energy than scaring kids. Our Main Characters Mike and Sully are known as the stop scarers of Monsters Incorporated, 
  however when Sully went back to get some papers for Mike a door is left active by one of the antagonists named Randal.
  Due to his action it let a little girl lose in the monster world. Putting the city in chaos and more. Within this journey Mike and Sully learn that this child isn’t dangerous and that their main goal is to send her back to the human world. However, they face many obstacles like hiding the girl in plain sight, 
  finding the door, and making sure Randall doesn’t expect anything. As we progress in the movie we learn that Randall made a machine to suck all the scream energy from a child.
  His plan is to kidnap all the kids instead of doing the job of scaring them. We also learn that the head of the company Mr. J. P. Waternoose is also involved in this plan as well. The company was going to die, 
  so he went for extreme measure saying he’ll kidnap 1,000 kids before he lets this company die and he’ll silence anyone who gets in his way. In turn, Sully and Mike caught him in the act of confessing and it was enough to put him away. 
  As for Randall he is trapped in the human world and takes to the little girl named Boo who faces her fears of being scared of Randall. In the end Mike and Sully brought Boo back to the Human world safe and sound and are running the company under better management instead getting scream energy they are now obtaining laughter as an energy. At the end Sully is able to see Boo once again and the movie ends.

  <h4> Question 2 <em>Why do I like this Film/Movie?</em><h4>
  <h5> Answer: The Theme and Story it brings</h5>
  <p><strong> I find this to be a great film, because as a kid we have the mentally of being scared of the dark, 
  thinking if there is a creature underneath the bed or closet.</strong> Having this movie brought the light in scary creatures. 
  For instance monsters aren’t real and they are figments of our imaginations. Furthermore, 
  it gave me a lesson that stuck by me for a while which is to never be scared, smile and bring laughter all around. 
  This goes into ensuring that we can get rid of bad energy by embracing that fear is irrelevant and that it’s in our head. 
  As long as we have that positive mentally and great energy all around the fear will go away and it won’t exist. 
  All we can do as human beings is to face what comes next and take it on in order to move forward and not backwards. 
  Beside it having a meaning the movie is just great. I love the characters, the plot, the funny moments and the action. 
  This movie always brings out the little kid that's inside of me and I’m glad I still have that in me.</p>

  <h6> Question 3 <em> Why should people watch this film/movie?</em><h6>
  <h7> Answer: The animation, charcaters, story, and how people can relate to the message of the Movie</h5>
  <p><strong> The reason I think people should see this film is because it's great for kids and family.</strong>
  Two the animation of the movie is great for it being made in 2001. 
  And also the message that it brings across not only to kids but for adults as well. 
  Furthermore, I believe this movie is a golden ticket in showing what an animation movie can provide. 
  You would think cause there aren’t actors it would be bad. 
  The voice over and the creativity with designing the characters the setting and objects shows how much thought was put into it as well. 
  Finally, Monster Inc will help kids and adults learn that facing your fears is possible and that everyone struggles with being scared and afraid. But like stated previously its possible.
